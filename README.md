#personal Keystroke Recorder (for Educational Purposes)
Important: This script is for personal, educational use only.  Do not use it to record the keystrokes of others without their explicit consent.  That is a serious invasion of privacy and may be illegal.

Description
This Python script is designed to capture and record keystrokes on your own computer.  It's a programming exercise to help you understand how keyboard input works and how data can be processed.  It sends the recorded keystrokes to a Discord channel via a webhook.

Key Features:

Keystroke Capture: Records keys pressed on your keyboard.

Discord Output: Sends the captured keystrokes to a Discord channel using a webhook.

Key Mapping: Converts special keys (like "Enter", "Space", "Shift") into readable text.

Buffering: Collects keystrokes before sending them, to avoid flooding the Discord channel.

Threaded Sending: Uses separate threads to capture keys and send data, ensuring smooth operation.

Queue Management: Uses a queue to handle messages, making the sending process more reliable.

Queue Size Limit: Includes a maximum queue size to prevent excessive memory usage.

Timeout: Prevents the program from getting stuck.

How It Works
Keystroke Listening: The script listens for keyboard events (key presses and releases) using the pynput library.

Key Processing: When a key is pressed, the script gets the character (e.g., "a", "1") or a description of the special key (e.g., "[ENTER]", "[SPACE]").

Buffering: The processed keystrokes are stored in a temporary list (the "buffer").

Sending to Discord:

The script sends the contents of the buffer to a Discord channel in these ways:

Every 0.5 seconds (this interval can be adjusted).

When you press the Escape key.

A separate thread handles sending the data to Discord, so the keylogger doesn't slow down.

A queue is used to manage the messages being sent, ensuring they are delivered in order.

Discord Webhook: The script uses a Discord webhook to send the keystrokes as messages.  A webhook is a way for an application to send messages to a Discord channel without needing a Discord bot.

Setup (For Personal Use Only)
Disclaimer:  Only use this script on your own computer and for educational purposes.

Python Installation: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.  You can download it from python.org.

Library Installation: Install the required Python libraries:

pip install pynput

Discord Webhook Setup:

Create a Discord server (if you don't have one).

Create a channel in your server where you want the keystrokes to be sent.

Create a webhook for that channel.  You can find instructions on how to do this in Discord's help documentation or by searching online.

Copy the Webhook URL. This URL is essential for the script to send messages.

Script Configuration:

Open the Python script (more_improved_keylogger_script.py) in a text editor.

Replace "YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN" with the actual path from your Discord Webhook URL. The WEBHOOK_URL should be "discord.com".  The WEBHOOK_PATH is the part after that.

Save the changes to the script.

Running the Script
Open a Terminal or Command Prompt: Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

Navigate to the Script's Directory: Use the cd command to go to the directory where you saved the Python script.  For example:

cd /path/to/your/script

Run the Script: Execute the script using the Python interpreter:

python more_improved_keylogger_script.py

Recording: The script will start recording your keystrokes.  The keystrokes will be sent to your Discord channel.

Stopping: To stop the script, press the Escape key (Esc).

Important Notes
Ethical Use: This script is for educational purposes only.  Do not use it to record the keystrokes of others without their explicit consent.
